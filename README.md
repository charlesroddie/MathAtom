## MathAtom

This is a research project to investigate if code sharing between
[wpf-math](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/wpf-math) and [CSharpMath](https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath)
is possible, and if it is, then at what degree.

Eventually [a new organisation](https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath/issues/4#issuecomment-425196488) and
[a new repository](https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath/issues/4#issuecomment-425634237) will be created,
so please click ![the watch button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-actions-watch.png)
so that you can follow along. Cheers!
